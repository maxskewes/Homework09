### Instructions for use
Type in rpm install into the command line.
Then run the program by typing node index.js into the command line.
When prompted, the user should enter their GitHub user name.
Next the user will see a prompt with four color options; the user should choose the color scheme they most prefer.
The program should then generate a file named index.html.
The program should then convert that HTML file into a .pdf.
Navigate back to the folder containing the original index.js file to open the .pdf or the newly created index.html should the user desire.
